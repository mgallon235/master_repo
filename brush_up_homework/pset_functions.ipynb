    "Suppose you want to update a code that gets daily stock data. We need to design a pipeline that is automated and updates our dataset efficiently.\n",

    "- First create a dataset that contains both date and a random number between 1 and 100. Store this dataset in a folder. You decide the format of storage but  read all the exercise before doing so.\n",
    "- Next, you will need to implement a code that keeps running forever and updates your dataset with a new random realization. The code has to run the update every day exactly at 15.00. That is, the code is always activated in your computer but only updates your dataset once per day.\n",
    "- Every day after the update, the dataset has to be stored and updated, ready to use.\n",

    "### Hints:\n",
    "- Make use of the schedule module to tell your code when to run.\n",
    "- Handle errors! It is important that your code does not disconnect on enters weird loops that make your computer break"
